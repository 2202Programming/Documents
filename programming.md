## Summery

As a wise man once said _repeatedly _"DOCUMENTATION", in order to help with that this document is designed to be a one-stop-shop for everything that one might need to build a robot. From the creation of a basic robot project in eclipse to contributing to the code we store on GitHub and a link to every guide you might ever need. Like all of our stuff will be going forward this is accessible on GitHub so we can work together to make it an even greater guide.

## Source Control

At this point you should be able to guess that we use GitHub as our method of source control, for those of you not familiar with GitHub\/Git then checkout this guide [here](), and if you have more questions on how to use GitHub\/running Git on a command line, and its more advanced features check [here]().

We use GitHub for two fronts. We use it as a distributed home for all of our source code and a public document holder, sometimes we even use web clients to access data stored in a repository from our programs, as well as keeping all of our team documentation on it. The other feature of GitHub we use is the Issues Features, GitHub's issues are a very easy to understand and we use them to map out what we are doing next how we are doing it when we want it to be done encourage collaboration and communication. For More details checkout out our GitFlow page [here]().

## Software

For more detail about software and how to install it check [here](/software.md), this will just describe the generics of what you will need to download the code from GitHub, Import the project, build, change, and they commit and push your changes back up to GitHub, on a windows machine.

For developing FRC Java robots we use Eclipse because it is the only IDE that FRC officially supports, so that is a must, in order to install that you must also install the Java JDK. Once that is install you also need to add the FRC extension to eclipse. This process is slightly complicated, so it's best if you follow First's steps for best results, you can find that guide [here.](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/13809/l/599681-installing-eclipse-c-java)

Once you have the Eclipse IDE installed you can start working on robot projects on your machine, but if you want to contribute to our official repository you must install some form of Git interface onto you computer. Now the number of Git interfaces is an extremely wide pool and is often more a preference of style or workflow rather than raw features. The simplest and easiest install is the [GitHub desktop client](https://desktop.github.com/), which is a simple install package wich comes with built-in command line tools, it is also what we have on the two Programming laptops, if you are looking for increased functionality and power another good alternative is  [GitKracken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) . Once you have your git client of choice installed you are ready to start downloading and checking-in code to the repository, for this make sure that you fallow our GitHub flow.

## Comunication

One of the most important aspects of managing a large team, or group or really anything that has more then two people working on it, communication becomes very important. Whether its asking for help or a code review, we need to be able to talk to each other, and one of our most powerfull tools is Slack, a channel based messenger system. Slack allows us to keep in touch with each other while not feeling spammed by messages. 

## Schedule

During the season we meet very regularly after the game lauch we are basicly working together non-stop, meeting ~3 days a week and spending time outside of meetings refineing our code even then. During the offseason we still try to meet regularly and work on creating new tools we can use during the season, and host events where we demonstrate our robot to other groups and orginizations, like a demonstration of what we do to componies that want to sponser the team, or host events for our current sponsers. 

## Goals

The basic goal of every programming team is to produce a program that fits the physical robot that is created, using our code to control the motion and useiblity of the robot. As a first team our goal is to expand the reach of STEM like pokemon, far and wide. And a strech goal for us, is to create software that we can reuse year after year, and even mayby distribute our applications to other teams.
