## Summery

As a wise man once said _repeatedly _"DOCUMENTATION", in order to help with that this document is designed to be a one-stop-shop for everything that one might need to build a robot. From the creation of a basic robot project in eclipse to contributing to the code we store on GitHub and a link to every guide you might ever need. Like all of our stuff will be going forward this is accessible on GitHub so we can work together to make it an even greater guide.

## Source Control

 At this point you should be able to guess that we use GitHub as our method of source control, for those of you not familiar with GitHub\/Git then checkout this guide [here](), and if you have more questions on how to use GitHub\/running Git on a command line, and its more advanced features check [here]().

 We use GitHub for two fronts. We use it as a distributed home for all of our source code and a public document holder, sometimes we even use web clients to access data stored in a repository from our programs, as well as keeping all of our team documentation on it. The other feature of GitHub we use is the Issues Features, GitHub's issues are a very easy to understand and we use them to map out what we are doing next how we are doing it when we want it to be done encourage collaboration and communication. For More details checkout out our GitFlow page [here]().

## Software

 For more detail about software and how to install it check [here](/software.md), this will just describe the generics of what you will need to download the code from GitHub, Import the project, build, change, and they commit and push your changes back up to GitHub, on a windows machine.

For developing FRC Java robots we use Eclipse because it is the only IDE that FRC officially supports, so that is a must, in order to install that you must also install the Java JDK. Once that is install you also need to add the FRC extension to eclipse. This process is slightly complicated, so it's best if you follow First's steps for best results, you can find that guide [here.](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/13809/l/599681-installing-eclipse-c-java)

 Once you have the Eclipse IDE installed you can start working on robot projects on your machine, but if you want to contribute to our official repository you must install some form of Git interface onto you computer. Now the number of Git interfaces is an extremely wide pool and is often more a preference of style or workflow rather than raw features. The simplest and easiest install is the [GitHub desktop client](https://desktop.github.com/), which is a simple install package wich comes with built-in command line tools, it is also what we have on the two Programming laptops, if you are looking for increased functionality and power another good alternative is  [GitKracken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) . Once you have your git client of choice installed you are ready to start downloading and checking-in code to the repository, for this make sure that you fallow our GitHub flow.

## Goals

The basic goal of every programming team is to produce a program that fits the physical robot that is created, using our code to control the motion and useiblity of the robot. As a first team our goal is to expand the reach of STEM like pokemon, far and wide.
