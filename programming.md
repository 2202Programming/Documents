## Summery

As a wise man once said _repeatidly_ "DOCUMENTATION", in oder to help with that this document is designed to be a one-stop shop for everything that one might need to build a robot. From the creation of a basic robot project in eclipse to contributing to the code we store on github and a link to every guide you might ever need. Like all of our stuff will be going forward this is accessable on github so we can work together to make it an even greater guide.

## Source Control

At this point you should be able to quess that we use GitHub as our method of source control, for those of you not familer with GitHub\/Git then checkout this quide [here](),  and if you have more questions on how to use GitHub\/running Git on a command line, and its more advanced features check [here]().

We use GitHub for two fronts. We use it as a distributed home for all of our souce code and a public document holder, sometimes we even use webclients to access data stored in a repository from our programs, as well as keeping all of our team documentation on it. The other feature of GitHub we use is the Issues Features, GitHub's issue's are a very easy to understand and we use them to map out what we are doing next how we are doing it when we want it to be done encourage collaboration and communication. For More details checkout out our GitFlow page [here]().
