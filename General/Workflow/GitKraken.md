## 1.0 Downloading GitKraken
The first step to using GitKraken is downloading the app. To do this go to the GitKraken webpage at [gitkraken.com](gitkraken.com "Download Page") and select the download for your operating system.
You can save the file anywhere you want.

Once you have GitKraken downloaded, run the installer and it will lead you through a short tutorial. Set your default profile to your github account.

## 2.0 Setting Your Preferences
Most of the options can be left alone, but there are a few that we will need to set.

- The first thing to set is project directory under the general tab. Set this to the same folder you use for your eclipse workspace. If you do not have a workspace, you can make a folder anywhere and choose that one. 
- Next under the general tab as well, set the auto-fetch interval to 20. You can set this higher or lower if you would like.
- Go to the Github tab of the authentification settings and click connect to Github. You do not need to set a ssh key. 
- Everything in git flow can be kept the same except the develop branch. Set this from develop to dev.
- UI preferences can be whatever you want.

## 3.0 Cloning Repos
To be able to work on code for Beast Robotics, you will need to clone the team's repostitory. To do this you will press the folder in the top left corner of GitKraken.

Navigate to the clone tab and select Github.com from the three options. Where to clone to should already be set to the folder set in preferences. All of the repos you have access to will also be listed here. Search for Tim.Jar (may change this name) and select it. Click clone the repo and you will be good to go.

## 4.0 Using Git Flow
The main feature of GitKraken that is different than other Git apps is the addition of Git Flow. Git flow is very important for organization and helps to keep your code from having too many merge errors.
To see detailed information about the workings of git flow see the branch structure document.

To create a branch using git flow, hover over the Git Flow tab on the left sidebar and select the arrow labeled open git flow. Here you can start any of the three Git Flow options. Most of the time you will only need to open feature branches. Note: Do not finish any features without consulting programming leadership.
