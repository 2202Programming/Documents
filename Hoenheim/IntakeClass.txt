How to run the Intake class:

To say you want it to be open/closed:
    -Call the setOpen method and pass in true if and only if you want it to be open
        -If you close the intake, it will automatically turn it off.
    -OpeningInProgress will return false as soon as it is at the state you requested
    
To say you want it to be intaking/extaking:
    -Call the isOn method and pass in 1 to intake, 0 to stop, and -1 to extake.
